## [1.0.0]
- Initial release

## [2.0.0]
* Add support for `<>`,`""` and `''`.
* Support double click `alt+a` to select include bracked, instead of `ctrl+alt+a`.
* Just click `alt+a` for multiple times, you will find how it works, enjoy it.

## [2.0.1]
- Remove support for `<>`, because it breaks other bracket if there is a case like `if (a > b)`
